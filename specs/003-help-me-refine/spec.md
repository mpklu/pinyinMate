# Feature Specification: Enhanced Interactive Lesson Learning Experience

**Feature Branch**: `003-help-me-refine`  
**Created**: September 30, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "help me refine lessons feature in this App. Currently the app loads static lessons from public/lessons/ folder and show them in Libary>Lesson page. Clicking \"preview \" does not do anything current. Clicking \"Start\" takes you to annotation page. I want to make the lesson page the most useful page for students to learn chinese. When clicked \"start\", it should load the lesson content and vocabulary if any. provide pinyin and audio playback  to help user study. A button to generate flashcards for all the words in vocabulary. And able to generate a quiz based on the content"

## Execution Flow (main)
```

   ‚Üí User wants to enhance lesson learning experience beyond current annotation page
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: Chinese language students, lesson content, vocabulary
   ‚Üí Actions: lesson loading, audio playback, pinyin display, flashcard generation, quiz creation
   ‚Üí Data: lesson content, vocabulary entries, pinyin, audio files
   ‚Üí Constraints: existing JSON lesson structure, current LibraryService architecture
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All requirements are clear from user description
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: select lesson ‚Üí study content ‚Üí generate study materials
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement focused on study experience enhancement
6. Identify Key Entities: Enhanced lesson page, vocabulary study tools, audio controls
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No implementation details included, focused on user value
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a Chinese language student, I want to start a lesson and have access to comprehensive study tools (content display, pinyin, audio, flashcards, quizzes) in one unified learning interface, so that I can efficiently study all aspects of the lesson without navigating between different pages.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I'm on the Library page viewing available lessons, **When** I click "Start" on any lesson, **Then** I should be taken to an enhanced lesson page that displays the lesson content with study tools
2. **Given** I'm on the lesson page, **When** the lesson loads, **Then** I should see the Chinese text content with pinyin annotations and vocabulary highlighted
3. **Given** I'm viewing lesson content, **When** I click on any text segment or vocabulary word, **Then** I should hear audio pronunciation for that text
4. **Given** I'm on a lesson page with vocabulary, **When** I click "Generate Flashcards", **Then** flashcards should be created for all vocabulary words and I should be able to study them
5. **Given** I'm on a lesson page, **When** I click "Generate Quiz", **Then** a quiz should be created based on the lesson content and vocabulary for me to test my understanding
6. **Given** I'm on the Library page, **When** I click "Preview" on any lesson, **Then** I should see a preview of the lesson content without entering full study mode

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a lesson has no vocabulary entries?
- How does the system handle lessons with very long content?
- What occurs when audio generation fails for certain text segments?
- How does the system behave when lesson content contains special characters or punctuation?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST replace the current annotation page navigation with a dedicated interactive lesson learning page when "Start" is clicked
- **FR-002**: System MUST display lesson content with automatic pinyin annotations for all Chinese characters
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide audio playback capability for individual text segments and vocabulary words
- **FR-004**: System MUST highlight vocabulary words within the lesson content and provide definitions on hover or click
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide a "Generate Flashcards" function that creates flashcards from all vocabulary entries in the lesson
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide a "Generate Quiz" function that creates questions based on lesson content and vocabulary
- **FR-007**: System MUST implement the currently non-functional "Preview" button to show lesson content without full study mode
- **FR-008**: System MUST segment lesson content into manageable chunks for audio playback and study
- **FR-009**: System MUST persist user progress and study session state during lesson interaction
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide navigation controls to return to library or access other study tools
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle lessons with varying amounts of vocabulary (including zero vocabulary lessons)
- **FR-012**: System MUST display lesson metadata (difficulty, estimated time, tags) prominently in the learning interface

### Key Entities
- **Enhanced Lesson Page**: A comprehensive learning interface that combines content display, audio controls, vocabulary tools, and study material generation
- **Interactive Content Display**: Text presentation with pinyin annotations, vocabulary highlighting, and segment-based navigation
- **Audio Control System**: Playback controls for text segments and vocabulary pronunciation
- **Study Material Generator**: Tools for creating flashcards and quizzes from lesson content
- **Vocabulary Study Tools**: Interactive vocabulary display with definitions, pronunciation, and context usage
