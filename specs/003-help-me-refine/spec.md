## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a Chinese language student, I want to start a lesson and have access to comprehensive study tools (content display, pinyin, audio, flashcards, quizzes) in one unified learning interface, so that I can efficiently study all aspects of the lesson without navigating between different pages.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I'm on the Library page viewing available lessons loaded via LibraryService, **When** I click "Start" on any lesson card, **Then** I should navigate to `/lesson/:id` route displaying the enhanced lesson page with study tools
2. **Given** I'm on the lesson page and the lesson loads from schema-validated JSON, **When** the lesson content renders, **Then** I should see Chinese text with pinyin annotations generated by pinyin-pro and vocabulary highlighted using existing SegmentHighlight components
3. **Given** I'm viewing lesson content with integrated AudioService, **When** I click on any text segment or vocabulary word, **Then** I should hear audio pronunciation using the Web Speech API integration
4. **Given** I'm on a lesson page with vocabulary from metadata.vocabulary array, **When** I click "Generate Flashcards", **Then** the system should use existing FlashcardService to create SRS-enabled flashcards and navigate to the flashcard study interface
5. **Given** I'm on a lesson page with validated lesson content, **When** I click "Generate Quiz", **Then** the system should use existing QuizService to create questions and navigate to the quiz interface
6. **Given** I'm on the Library page with existing LessonCard components, **When** I click "Preview" on any lesson, **Then** I should see a Material-UI dialog/modal with lesson content preview without entering full study mode
7. **Given** I have lesson data conforming to the documented schema, **When** the system loads lessons from local or remote sources, **Then** all lessons should be validated using the established validation utilities and display properly
8. **Given** I'm using the enhanced lesson interface, **When** I interact with study features, **Then** my progress should be persisted using the existing SessionContext and localStorage patterns

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a lesson has an empty vocabulary array in metadata?
- How does the system handle lessons with content exceeding character count limits defined in the schema?
- What occurs when Web Speech API is unavailable or audio synthesis fails for certain text segments?
- How does the system behave when lesson schema validation fails for remote library sources?
- What happens when pinyin-pro library fails to load or generate pinyin for certain characters?
- How does the system handle lessons with missing or invalid source/book metadata properties?
- What occurs when the existing LessonService or LibraryService encounters processing errors?
- How does the system respond when localStorage is unavailable for session persistence?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST replace the current annotation page navigation with a dedicated interactive lesson learning page when "Start" is clicked
- **FR-002**: System MUST display lesson content with automatic pinyin annotations using existing pinyin-pro library
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide audio playback capability using existing Web Speech API integration for text segments and vocabulary words
