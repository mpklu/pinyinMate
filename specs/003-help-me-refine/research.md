## 1. Chinese Text Processing Integration

**Decision**: Leverage existing pinyin-pro library with TextSegmentationService enhancement

**Rationale**: 
- Existing `pinyinService.ts` already implements dynamic loading of pinyin-pro v3 with proper browser compatibility
- Current service provides tone mark generation (`toneType: 'symbol'`) which is essential for learning
- TextSegmentationService exists but uses basic fallback segmentation that needs enhancement
- Pinyin-pro supports both character-level and word-level processing required for vocabulary highlighting

**Implementation Approach**:
- Extend existing `LessonServiceImpl.segmentLessonText()` to use enhanced segmentation
- Integrate pinyin generation at segment creation time rather than runtime for performance
- Utilize existing `validatePinyinInput()` for input validation
- Leverage existing performance monitoring in `pinyinService.ts`

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Real-time pinyin generation: Rejected due to performance concerns with large lesson content
- Third-party segmentation libraries: Rejected to maintain dependency consistency with existing pinyin-pro

## 2. Audio Integration Patterns  

**Decision**: Extend existing Web Speech API implementation with sentence-level segmentation

**Rationale**:
- Existing `audioService.ts` provides Web Speech API integration with Chinese language support
- Current implementation includes `validateAudioRequest()` and proper error handling
- Existing service supports speed/pitch controls which enhance learning experience
- Web Speech API provides better Chinese pronunciation than custom TTS solutions

**Implementation Approach**:
- Enhance existing `AudioSynthesizeRequest` interface to support segment-level audio
- Utilize existing `isWebSpeechAvailable()` check for progressive enhancement
- Integrate with lesson text segmentation to provide clickable audio for individual words
- Extend existing audio validation to handle batch processing of lesson segments

**Technical Patterns**:
- Sentence-level audio: Use existing TextSegmentationService with period/comma detection
- Word-level audio: Leverage vocabulary highlighting integration for individual word playback
- Audio queue management: Implement sequential playback with existing service patterns

**Alternatives Considered**:
- MeloTTS integration: Rejected due to complexity and existing Web Speech API sufficiency
- Pre-recorded audio files: Rejected due to storage requirements and inflexibility

## 3. Lesson Metadata Validation

**Decision**: Utilize existing schema validation utilities with lesson-specific enhancements  

**Rationale**:
- Comprehensive lesson schema already documented in `docs/lesson-schema.md`
- JSON Schema validation implemented in `schemas/lesson.schema.json`
- TypeScript validation utilities exist in `src/utils/lessonValidation.ts`
- Existing validation supports both local and remote lesson sources

**Implementation Approach**:
- Use existing `validateLesson()` function for schema compliance
- Leverage existing `validateMetadata()` for source/book attribution
- Utilize existing `cleanLessonData()` for data migration and sanitization
- Integrate with existing `LessonServiceImpl.processLesson()` for enhanced validation

**Validation Points**:
- Schema compliance: Use existing JSON Schema validation
- Vocabulary structure: Validate `metadata.vocabulary` array format
- Source attribution: Validate required `metadata.source` field
- Content integrity: Use existing character count and format validation

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Runtime validation only: Rejected in favor of build-time + runtime validation
- Custom validation library: Rejected to maintain consistency with existing validation patterns

## 4. Navigation and Routing Integration

**Decision**: Extend existing React Router v7 configuration with new lesson route

**Rationale**:
- Existing router in `src/router/index.tsx` uses lazy loading and Suspense boundaries
- Current routing supports preloading services which benefits lesson loading performance
- Existing navigation patterns in LibraryPage support lesson start/preview actions
- Route structure already supports parameterized paths for individual resources

**Implementation Approach**:
- Add `/lesson/:id` route to existing router configuration
- Utilize existing `preloadServices.library()` pattern for lesson preloading
- Integrate with existing `PageLoadingFallback` for consistent UX
- Leverage existing lazy loading patterns from `utils/lazyLoading.ts`

**Navigation Flow**:
- Library → Lesson: Use existing `onLessonStart` prop in LibraryPage
- Lesson → Back: Utilize existing `onNavigateBack` pattern
- Preview Modal: Extend existing Material-UI Modal patterns in LibraryPage

## 5. Study Tools Integration

**Decision**: Integrate with existing quiz service and implement flashcard service extension

**Rationale**:
- Existing `quizService.ts` provides quiz generation from annotated content
- Current quiz service supports multiple question types and validation
- Flashcard functionality exists in types but needs service implementation
- Existing SRS (Spaced Repetition System) integration ready for flashcard enhancement

**Implementation Approach**:
- **Quiz Integration**: Extend existing `QuizGenerateRequest` to support lesson-based generation
- **Flashcard Generation**: Implement new service following existing quiz service patterns
- **Service Integration**: Utilize existing service architecture with `LessonServiceImpl`
- **UI Integration**: Use existing floating action button patterns from Material-UI

**Service Patterns**:
- Follow existing validation patterns from `validateQuizRequest()`
- Use existing question type generation from `quizService.ts`
- Implement flashcard service with similar performance monitoring
- Integrate with existing SessionContext for progress tracking

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Separate microservices: Rejected in favor of existing monolithic approach
- External study tools: Rejected to maintain data privacy and offline capability

## 6. Component Architecture Integration

**Decision**: Follow existing atomic design patterns with lesson-specific template

**Rationale**:
- Existing component structure follows atoms/molecules/organisms/templates pattern
- Current LessonCard molecules provide foundation for lesson display
- Existing LibraryPage template demonstrates lesson browser integration
- Material-UI v5 components provide consistent theming and accessibility

**Implementation Approach**:
- **Template Level**: Create new LessonPage template following LibraryPage patterns
- **Organism Level**: Implement LessonContent organism for text display and interaction
- **Molecule Level**: Extend existing LessonCard for enhanced metadata display
- **Atom Level**: Utilize existing AudioButton, Button, Card atoms

**Component Hierarchy**:
```
LessonPage (Template) 
├── LessonContent (Organism)
│   ├── TextSegmentDisplay (Molecule)
│   ├── VocabularyHighlight (Molecule)
│   └── AudioControls (Molecule)
├── StudyToolsPanel (Organism)
│   ├── FlashcardGenerator (Molecule)
│   └── QuizGenerator (Molecule)
└── LessonProgress (Organism)
```

**Design Consistency**:
- Use existing Material-UI theme system from `src/theme/theme.ts`
- Follow existing responsive design patterns
- Maintain accessibility standards from existing components
- Utilize existing loading states and error boundaries

## 7. Performance Optimization Strategy

**Decision**: Leverage existing lazy loading and performance monitoring patterns

**Rationale**:
- Existing `utils/lazyLoading.ts` provides component-level lazy loading
- Current performance monitoring in `utils/performanceMonitor.ts` supports metrics tracking
- Existing service architecture includes performance considerations
- Lesson content can be large, requiring careful memory management

**Implementation Approach**:
- **Component Lazy Loading**: Use existing lazy loading patterns for lesson page
- **Content Chunking**: Implement progressive loading for large lesson content
- **Service Caching**: Extend existing caching patterns in services
- **Memory Management**: Use existing performance monitoring for optimization

**Performance Targets**:
- Initial page load: < 2s (matching existing pages)
- Audio response time: < 500ms (Web Speech API standard)
- Pinyin generation: < 200ms per segment
- Memory usage: Monitor with existing performance tools
