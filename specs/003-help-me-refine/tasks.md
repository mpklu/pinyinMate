- Enhanced lesson processing with text segmentation and pinyin generation
- Audio synthesis with Web Speech API integration and performance optimization
- Flashcard generation with SRS integration and template system
- Quiz generation with multiple question types and validation

**Implementation Status**: ✅ Core Services (T020-T025) COMPLETED with 164/164 contract tests passing

- AudioSynthesisService: Web Speech API integration with performance optimization
- FlashcardGenerationService: SRS integration with 6 flashcard types
- QuizGenerationService: Multiple question types with audio integration

**Next Priority**: Begin with T026-T038 (UI Components) now that service foundation is complete.

## Task Organization
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Tech stack: TypeScript 5.8 + React 19.1 + Material-UI v5, Vite, pinyin-pro v3, Web Speech API
   → Project type: Web application (single project structure)
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: 8 entities → model enhancement tasks
   → contracts/: 4 service contracts → contract test tasks  
   → research.md: Technical decisions → setup tasks
   → quickstart.md: 6 integration scenarios → integration test tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: route configuration, component structure, service enhancements
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests for all scenarios
   → Core: entity models, service implementations, UI components
   → Integration: routing, study tools, progress tracking
   → Polish: unit tests, performance optimization, accessibility
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All 4 contracts have tests? ✓
   → All 8 entities have implementations? ✓
   → All 6 integration scenarios covered? ✓
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

- **TDD Critical**: Verify ALL tests fail before implementing (T004-T015 before T016-T049)
- **Atomic Design**: Follow established component hierarchy (atoms → molecules → organisms → templates)
- **Constitutional Compliance**: Mobile-first, max 3 actions per screen, accessible design
- **Commit Strategy**: Commit after each task completion for incremental progress
