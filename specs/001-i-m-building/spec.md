**Feature Branch**: `001-i-m-building`  
**Created**: 2025-09-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I'm building a modern web app that helps kids learning chinese as 2nd language. It's learner-facing App ,simple, guided;  focus on emphasizes reading with pinyin, quick quizzes, flashcards. I want it to look sleek, something that would stand out. No user/login management. No data persistence for user added data. Annotate /annotate Paste/Upload Chinese → Get segmented text + pinyin + tone marks → save as deck/lesson. Reader /reader/:id Clean reading view with toggles (show/hide pinyin, per-word gloss, tone coloring, audio). Quizzes /quiz/:id Auto-generated from a lesson/deck; supports several quiz types (see §6). Flashcards /flashcards Daily SRS queue, browse decks, import/export. add user to export any generated or static quiz and flash cards as PDF or format any popular Flash Card App if any Library /library - project may provide static chines text organized as book -> lession -> section"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-28
- Q: What quiz formats should be included for "multiple quiz types" auto-generated from lessons? → A: Multiple choice + Fill-in-blank + Matching + Audio recognition
- Q: How should session data be handled given "no data persistence for user added data"? → A: No session data storage - static content only, released with app
- Q: How should audio pronunciations be provided for Chinese text? → A: MeloTTS if feasible, or best judgment choice
- Q: Which specific formats should be supported for flashcard export to "popular flashcard applications"? → A: Anki (.apkg) + Quizlet import format
- Q: How should the SRS (Spaced Repetition System) work for flashcards without storing user progress? → A: Session-only SRS that resets on page refresh

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A child learning Chinese as a second language visits the web app to practice reading Chinese text. They can paste or upload Chinese content to create temporary interactive lessons with pinyin annotations, practice with auto-generated quizzes, and use flashcards for spaced repetition learning. The app provides a clean, distraction-free learning environment with visual and audio aids to support comprehension.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a child has Chinese text to practice, **When** they paste it into the annotation tool, **Then** the system segments the text, adds pinyin and tone marks, and creates a temporary lesson for the session
2. **Given** a temporary lesson exists, **When** the child opens the reader view, **Then** they can toggle pinyin visibility, word glosses, tone coloring, and audio playback
3. **Given** a completed lesson, **When** the child starts a quiz, **Then** the system auto-generates multiple quiz types based on the lesson content
4. **Given** the child uses flashcards, **When** they access the flashcard section, **Then** they see a daily SRS queue and can browse available decks
5. **Given** the child wants to practice offline, **When** they export materials, **Then** they can download PDFs or formats compatible with popular flashcard apps
6. **Given** structured content exists in the library, **When** the child browses, **Then** they can access organized Chinese texts by book, lesson, and section

### Edge Cases
- What happens when uploaded text contains non-Chinese characters or mixed languages?
- How does the system handle audio playback failures or missing audio files?
- What occurs when export functionality fails or produces corrupted files?
- How does the app behave with extremely long texts that might impact performance?
- What happens when SRS scheduling conflicts with daily usage patterns?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept Chinese text input via paste or file upload in the annotation tool
