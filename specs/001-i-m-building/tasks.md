## Dependencies

### Critical Path
- Setup (T001-T007) before everything
- Contract tests (T008-T012) before service implementation (T022-T027)
- Integration tests (T013-T017) before page implementation (T040-T046)
- Types (T018-T021) before services and components
- Services (T022-T027) before components that use them
- Atoms (T028-T031) before molecules (T032-T035)
- Molecules (T032-T035) before organisms (T036-T039)
- Components before pages (T036-T039 before T040-T046)
- Core implementation before integration (T047-T052)
- Everything before polish (T053-T066)

### Specific Dependencies
- T022 (segmentation) blocks T036 (annotation panel)

- T024 (quiz generation) blocks T038 (quiz interface)
- T025 (SRS) blocks T039 (flashcard deck)
- T026 (audio) blocks T030 (audio button)
- T027 (export) blocks T035 (export options)
- T040 (routing) blocks all page components (T041-T046)
- T047-T048 (contexts) needed by T049-T050 (hooks)
