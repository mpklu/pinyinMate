# Tasks: Enhanced Library and Lesson System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-help-enhance-complete/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory âœ“
   â†’ Tech stack: TypeScript 5.8+, React 19.1+, Material-UI v5
   â†’ Structure: Single-page web application (frontend only)
2. Load optional design documents: âœ“
   â†’ data-model.md: Library, Lesson, Flashcard, QuizQuestion entities
   â†’ contracts/: LibraryService, LessonService, AudioService
   â†’ research.md: Web Speech API, JSON manifest approach
3. Generate tasks by category: âœ“
   â†’ Setup: TypeScript interfaces, service structure, remote sources config
   â†’ Tests: contract tests, integration tests for user journeys
   â†’ Core: services, components (atomsâ†’moleculesâ†’organismsâ†’templates)
   â†’ Integration: audio API, pinyin generation, remote loading
   â†’ Polish: accessibility, performance, mobile optimization
4. Apply task rules: âœ“
   â†’ Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   â†’ Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...) âœ“
6. Generate dependency graph âœ“
7. Create parallel execution examples âœ“
8. Validate task completeness: âœ“
   â†’ All contracts have tests âœ“
   â†’ All entities have models âœ“
   â†’ All user journeys implemented âœ“
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution) âœ“
```

## Task Generation Rules Applied

### From Contracts
- âœ… LibraryService â†’ T007, T008 (contract tests) + T018 (implementation)
- âœ… LessonService â†’ T009, T010, T011 (contract tests) + T019 (implementation)
- âœ… AudioService â†’ T012, T013 (contract tests) + T020 (implementation)

### From Data Model
- âœ… Library entity â†’ T001 (TypeScript interface)
- âœ… Lesson entity â†’ T002 (TypeScript interface)
- âœ… Flashcard entity â†’ T003 (TypeScript interface)
- âœ… QuizQuestion entity â†’ T004 (TypeScript interface)

### From User Stories (Quickstart)
- âœ… Library browsing journey â†’ T014 (integration test)
- âœ… Lesson study journey â†’ T015 (integration test)
- âœ… Flashcard study journey â†’ T016 (integration test)
- âœ… Quiz experience journey â†’ T017 (integration test)

### Ordering Rules Applied
- âœ… Setup (T001-T006) â†’ Tests (T007-T017) â†’ Services (T018-T023) â†’ Components (T024-T043) â†’ Integration (T047-T052) â†’ Polish (T053-T067)
- âœ… TDD: All tests before implementation
- âœ… Component hierarchy: Atoms â†’ Molecules â†’ Organisms â†’ Templates

## Validation Checklist

- âœ… All contracts have corresponding tests (T007-T013)
- âœ… All entities have model tasks (T001-T004)
- âœ… All tests come before implementation (T007-T017 before T018+)
- âœ… Parallel tasks truly independent ([P] marked appropriately)
- âœ… Each task specifies exact file path
- âœ… No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- âœ… Constitutional compliance tasks included (T056-T059 for accessibility/mobile)
- âœ… Performance requirements addressed (T060-T061)
- âœ… Error handling requirements covered (T062-T063)

## Notes
- **Total Tasks**: 69 tasks across 10 phases
- **Parallel Opportunities**: 47 tasks marked [P] for concurrent execution
- **Critical Path**: Setup â†’ Tests â†’ Services â†’ Component Hierarchy â†’ Integration â†’ Polish
- **Estimated Duration**: 8-10 development days with parallel execution
- **Key Risk Areas**: Audio API compatibility (T020, T055), Remote source loading (T018, T062)
- **Quality Gates**: All contract tests must fail before implementation begins
