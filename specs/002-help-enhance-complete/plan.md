# Implementation Plan: Enhanced Library and Lesson System

**Branch**: `002-help-enhance-complete` | **Date**: September 29, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-help-enhance-complete/spec.md`

## Execut**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/tasks command)Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Enhanced library and lesson system enabling Chinese language learners to browse organized collections from local/remote sources, study content with sentence-level audio pronunciation, and practice with interactive flashcards and multi-modal quizzes. Supports predefined remote URI sources with toggle controls, linear flashcard navigation, and simplified lesson data format focusing on content and vocabulary.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.8+ with React 19.1+  
**Primary Dependencies**: Material-UI v5, React Router v7, pinyin-pro v3, jsPDF v3, Web Speech API  
**Storage**: Static JSON files (local/remote), browser localStorage for settings/progress  
**Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library + Playwright E2E + jest-axe for accessibility  
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (mobile-first responsive design)
**Project Type**: Single-page web application (frontend only)  
**Performance Goals**: <3s initial load, <1s navigation, sentence-level audio latency <500ms  
**Constraints**: Mobile-first design (320px+), WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, offline-capable lesson storage  
**Scale/Scope**: ~10-50 lessons per library, 5-10 remote sources, 100+ vocabulary words per lesson

**Structure Decision**: Single-page web application structure leveraging the existing atomic design component architecture. The lesson library system extends current services while maintaining separation of concerns between data loading, processing, and presentation components.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Contract-driven development: Each service contract → test suite task [P]
- Data model tasks: TypeScript interfaces and validation schemas [P]
- Service implementation: LibraryService, LessonService, AudioService
- Component tasks: Library browser, lesson viewer, flashcard deck, quiz interface
- Integration tasks: User journey validation from quickstart scenarios

**Ordering Strategy**:
1. **Foundation Layer** [P]: Type definitions, data models, validation schemas
2. **Service Layer**: Contract tests → Service implementations → Service integration
3. **Component Layer**: Atomic components → Molecules → Organisms → Templates
4. **Integration Layer**: User journey tests → Performance validation → Accessibility compliance
5. **Polish Layer**: Error handling refinement, mobile optimization, audio fallbacks

**Dependency Management**:
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files/interfaces)
- Sequential dependencies: Services before components, tests before implementations
- Critical path: LibraryService → LessonService → UI components

**Constitutional Compliance Tasks**:
- Mobile-first responsive design validation
- Accessibility testing with jest-axe
- Performance budget compliance verification
- Component architecture review

**Estimated Task Breakdown**:
```
Foundation:     8 tasks (types, models, validation)
Services:      12 tasks (3 services × 4 tasks each)
Components:    15 tasks (4 templates + 11 supporting components)
Integration:    8 tasks (user journeys, performance, a11y)
Polish:         5 tasks (error handling, mobile, audio)
Total:         48 tasks
```

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Audio API compatibility testing prioritized early
- Remote source handling isolated and testable
- Flashcard/quiz generation as separate, parallel workstreams
- Progressive enhancement for audio features

**Quality Gates**:
- Each service must pass contract tests before UI integration
- Mobile-first design verified at component level
- Performance benchmarks validated before user testing
- Accessibility compliance verified with automated tools

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
