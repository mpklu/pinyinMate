# Feature Specification: Enhanced Library and Lesson System

**Feature Branch**: `002-help-enhance-complete`  
**Created**: September 29, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "help enhance/complete the libary/lessons pages. Lessons should be imported either from local static files or remote source provided by static URI list stored locally. Library should contain a list of collections. Each remote source should be represent a unique library. Each library contains a list of lessons. Those sample lessons under public/ is a starting point. I want to keep source data simple, it should contains chinese text context and necessary metadata. vocabulary should be at the same level of content as some text book source provide both content and vocabulary. And vocabulary should be just a list of words as pinyin is generated at runtime. grammarPoints and culturalNotes are optional. We do not need audio in lesson data. lesson data should also contain optional book, series property and a src property (to identify it's source). User browses libary and pick a lesson, click Start to start learning. The lesson page should have option to show all the content text, vocabulary if there's one. Have ability to listen to the Audio Pronunciation like in the annotate page. Possibly one paragraph or section at a time. Lesson page should have FlashCards and Quiz option which generates flashcards and quizs for user to study. A flashCard should Chinese word on the front, Show English transactiona and pinyin on top of the Chinese word in the back. The back also provides a button for audio playback. Clicking anywhere in the flashcard flips it, so does not need a dedicated button."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input ‚úì
   ‚Üí Feature clear: Enhanced library/lesson system with local/remote sources
2. Extract key concepts from description ‚úì
   ‚Üí Actors: Chinese language learners
   ‚Üí Actions: browse libraries, select lessons, study content, use flashcards/quizzes
   ‚Üí Data: lesson content, vocabulary, metadata, libraries, collections
   ‚Üí Constraints: simple data format, runtime pinyin generation, audio integration
3. For each unclear aspect: ‚úì
   ‚Üí All key aspects are well-defined in user input
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section ‚úì
   ‚Üí Clear user flow: browse ‚Üí select ‚Üí study ‚Üí practice
5. Generate Functional Requirements ‚úì
   ‚Üí Each requirement testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities ‚úì
   ‚Üí Libraries, Collections, Lessons, Vocabulary, Flashcards, Quizzes
7. Run Review Checklist ‚úì
   ‚Üí No implementation details, focused on user needs
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning) ‚úì
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-29
- Q: When the system generates quiz questions from lesson vocabulary and content, what types of questions should be supported? ‚Üí A: Multiple choice + fill-in-the-blank + audio recognition (listen and select/type)
- Q: How should users configure the remote URI lists for importing lessons from external sources? ‚Üí A: Predefined list with enable/disable toggles only
- Q: When a remote source fails to load or returns invalid lesson data, what should happen? ‚Üí A: Show error message and skip that source entirely
- Q: When users are studying flashcards generated from a lesson, how should they navigate through the deck? ‚Üí A: Linear only (next/previous buttons, no skipping)
- Q: When displaying lesson content (Chinese text), how should the text be segmented for audio playback? ‚Üí A: Sentence-by-sentence (each sentence is one audio segment)

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a Chinese language learner, I want to browse through organized collections of lessons from various sources (local files and remote libraries), select a lesson that interests me, study the content with audio pronunciation support, and practice using interactive flashcards and quizzes to reinforce my learning.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am on the library page, **When** I view the available collections, **Then** I see a list of libraries with lessons organized by source and difficulty level
2. **Given** I select a lesson from a collection, **When** I click "Start", **Then** I am taken to the lesson page showing the Chinese text content
3. **Given** I am viewing lesson content, **When** I click on text sections, **Then** I hear audio pronunciation for that section
4. **Given** I am on a lesson page, **When** I click "FlashCards", **Then** I see cards with Chinese words on front and English/pinyin on back
5. **Given** I am viewing a flashcard, **When** I click anywhere on the card, **Then** the card flips to show the back with translation, pinyin, and audio button
6. **Given** I am on a lesson page, **When** I click "Quiz", **Then** I get questions generated from the lesson's vocabulary and content
7. **Given** I want to study from different sources, **When** I configure remote URI lists, **Then** lessons from those sources appear as separate libraries

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a remote source is unavailable or returns invalid data? ‚Üí System displays error message and skips that source entirely
- How does the system handle lessons without vocabulary lists?
- What occurs when audio generation fails for certain text segments?
- How are duplicate lessons from different sources managed?
